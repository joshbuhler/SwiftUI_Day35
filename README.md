# 100 Days of Swift UI

Related to my work while following the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) series.

The remainder of the work can be found here: [https://github.com/joshbuhler/SwiftUI_100Days](https://github.com/joshbuhler/SwiftUI_100Days). I just wanted to have this one as a separate repo for reasons.

## Day 35 Challenge

This is a dirt-simple project to sort out the [Day 35 challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/3/3/challenge). The goal here was to follow existing patterns I use at work, and to make the code as testable as possible. Doesn't use mock views with the presenter, but through the use of `@ObservableObject` that wasn't needed for this project.
